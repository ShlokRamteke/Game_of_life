# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which can be in one of two possible states: alive or dead.

## About the Game

The rules of the game are simple:
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation.

The game demonstrates interesting patterns and behaviors that emerge from these simple rules. It has been studied extensively in the field of cellular automata and has applications in various areas, including computer science, biology, and artificial life.

## How to Play

1. Open the [Game of Life](https://shlokramteke.github.io/Game_of_life/) app in your web browser.
2. The game canvas will display a grid of cells.
3. Use the "Increase Size" and "Decrease Size" buttons to adjust the size of the grid.
4. The game will automatically evolve according to the rules.
